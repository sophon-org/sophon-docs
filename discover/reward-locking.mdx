<Tip>
  **Sophon Points (SP)** are a rewards mechanism within the Sophon ecosystem. SP
  accrual allows users to participate in ecosystem growth and benefit from
  future incentives.

## Locking Period

All earned **Sophon Points (SP)** are converted to **SOPH** and are thus locked until the **Token Generation Event (TGE)** (expected to happen during the first half of 2025).

During this period:

- **SOPH** cannot be **transferred, sold,** or **redeemed**.
- **SP** and **SOPH balances** will continue to accumulate based on participation in **farming** and **node operations**.

## Unlocking at TGE

<Warning>
  Upon **TGE, SOPH** may be **converted, redeemed,** or **used** based on the
  final **tokenomics** and **distribution plan**. Further details will be
  provided closer to the event.
</Warning>
