<Tip>
**Sophon Points (SP)** are a rewards mechanism within the Sophon ecosystem. SP accrual allows users to participate in ecosystem growth and benefit from future incentives.
</Tip>

## Locking Period

All earned Sophon Points (SP) remain locked until the **Token Generation Event (TGE)**. During this period:

- SP cannot be **transferred, sold,** or **redeemed**.
- SP balances will continue to accumulate based on participation in **farming** and **node operations**.

## Unlocking at TGE

<Warning>
Upon **TGE, SP** may be **converted, redeemed,** or **used based** on the final **$SOPH tokenomics** and distribution plan. Further details will be provided closer to the event.
</Warning>
