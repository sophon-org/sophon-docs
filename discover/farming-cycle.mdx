title: 'Farming Cycle'

Understanding the farming cycle is key to maximizing **Sophon Points (SP)** earned and participating in the broader **Sophon ecosystem**. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the process:

---

## Ethereum Mainnet

The initial phase of the farming cycle begins on **Ethereum Mainnet**, where users can deposit assets and start accumulating **Sophon Points**.

- **Accrual of Sophon Points**: Sophon Points will continue to accrue as long as the assets are held in the farming pools.
- **Bridging to Sophon Mainnet**: Once the assets are bridged to **Sophon Mainnet**, the points will stop accruing on Ethereum Mainnet.
- **Duration**: The specific duration of this farming period will be announced at a later date.

<Info>The Ethereum Mainnet farming phase is crucial for early participants to accumulate points before assets transition to the Sophon Mainnet.</Info>

## Sophon Mainnet

Once **Sophon Mainnet** is launched, a few important changes will occur for all participants:

- **Asset Transfer**: All assets previously deposited on Ethereum Mainnet will be **permissionlessly transferred** to Sophon Mainnet and will become **immediately accessible**.
- **New Deposits and Boosts**: New deposits and boosts can be made on Sophon Mainnet.
  
<Note>Assets boosted on Ethereum Mainnet will remain locked for liquidity. Users who do not withdraw will receive **retroactive SP rewards** for the pause week. Withdrawn assets will forfeit these rewards, though SPs from boosts will **still be awarded** as boosts cannot be withdrawn.</Note>

- **Reward Calculation**: The accumulated **Sophon Points** on the Sophon Mainnet will be used to calculate rewards in **$SOPH** tokens, based on the allocated percentage of the token supply for that period.

<Tip>To maximize your rewards, keep an eye on announcements about the specific allocation percentages and farming phases on Sophon Mainnet.</Tip>

## Key Takeaways

- **Ethereum Mainnet**: Earn Sophon Points by depositing assets and bridging to Sophon Mainnet.
- **Sophon Mainnet**: Assets are transferred and immediately accessible; previously boosted assets are locked, and rewards are calculated using accumulated points.

<Info>By understanding the cycle and timing your farming strategy, you can maximize your potential rewards in the Sophon ecosystem.</Info>
