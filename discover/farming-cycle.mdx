title: "Farming Cycle"
---

Understanding the farming cycle is key to maximizing **Sophon Points (SP)** earned and participating in the broader **Sophon ecosystem**. Here’s a breakdown of the process:

---

## Ethereum Mainnet

The initial phase of the farming cycle begins on **Ethereum Mainnet**, where users can deposit assets and start accumulating **Sophon Points**.

- **Accrual of Sophon Points**: Sophon Points will continue to accrue as long as the assets are held in the farming pools.
- **Bridging to Sophon Mainnet**: Once the assets are bridged to **Sophon Mainnet**, the points will stop accruing on Ethereum Mainnet.
- **Duration**: The specific duration of this farming period will be announced at a later date.

<Info>
  The Ethereum Mainnet farming phase is crucial for early participants to accumulate points before assets transition to the Sophon Mainnet.

## Sophon Mainnet

When **Sophon Mainnet** was launched, a few important changes will occur for all participants:

- **Asset Transfer**: All assets previously deposited on Ethereum Mainnet were **permissionlessly transferred** to Sophon Mainnet and became **immediately accessible**.
- **New Deposits and Boosts**: New deposits can be made on Sophon Mainnet, but boosts were deactivated.

<Note>
  Assets boosted on Ethereum Mainnet will remain locked for liquidity. Users who did not withdraw received **retroactive SP rewards** for the pause week. Withdrawn assets will forfeit these rewards, though SPs from boosts will **still be awarded** as boosts cannot be withdrawn.
</Note>

- **Reward Calculation**: The accumulated **Sophon Points** on the Sophon Mainnet will be used to calculate rewards in **SOPH** tokens, based on the allocated percentage of the token supply for that period.

<Tip>
  To maximize your rewards, keep an eye on announcements about the specific allocation percentages and farming phases on Sophon Mainnet.

## Key Takeaways

- **Ethereum Mainnet**: Earn Sophon Points by depositing assets and bridging to Sophon Mainnet.
- **Sophon Mainnet**: Assets are transferred and immediately accessible; previously boosted assets are locked, and rewards are calculated using accumulated points.

<Info>
  By understanding the cycle and timing your farming strategy, you can maximize your potential rewards in the Sophon ecosystem.

## Sophon farming conclusion

Phase 2 of Sophon Farming will come to an end on **June 30th, 2025**. The last emission of SPs will happen on this date, at **23h59m59s UTC**. After that, the SP-to-SOPH conversion will be calculated, and rewards will be distributed to each farm.\
SOPH reward streams will be initialized by **July 4th, 2025**, with the following characteristics:

- A specific amount of SOPH (reflecting the total rewards accrued during the farming period)
- A start date of **May 28th at 00:00 UTC**
- A **6-month lockup**
- A **6-month vesting period** – meaning that once the 6-month cliff ends, the stream begins to vest and concludes 6 months later.
  - _For example, if you choose to claim part of the stream 1 month after vesting starts, you will be able to claim 16.67% of the total. The rest will continue accumulating and will be available to claim in the future._
