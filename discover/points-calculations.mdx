Sophon Farming is a way to earn rewards by staking your tokens in various pools. This guide explains how the system works and how to optimize your earnings.

<Info>
**Key Concepts**
- Points are generated **every block** and shared across pools.
- Your earnings are based on your **staked tokens**.
- **Boosting** can increase your rewards.
- **Pool values** determine **point distribution**.
- Some pools have a **multiplier** greater than 1.
</Info>

## Points Distribution

**Block Generation**

Every block, a fixed number of points (`10 SPs`) are created and distributed among active pools based on their relative value.

**Example:**

Imagine we have 3 active pools with a combined value of $1,000:

<Note>**Pool A:** $500 value (50% of total)</Note>
- Gets **5 SPs** per block (50% of 10 SPs)

<Note>**Pool B:** $300 value (30% of total)</Note>
- Gets **3 SPs** per block (30% of 10 SPs)

<Note>Pool C: $200 value (20% of total)</Note>
- Gets **2 SPs** per block (20% of 10 SPs)

<Tip>
- **Total System Value:** $1,000
- **Total SPs Per Block:** 10 SPs
- **Emission Rate:** 0.01 SP per USD equivalent staked
- **Pool A Share:** 0.005 SPs (50% of emissions)
</Tip>

### Pool Value Calculation

```
Pool Value = (Total Tokens Staked Ã— Token Price Ã— Pool Multiplier)
```

The higher a pool's relative value, the more points it receives from the global distribution.

#### Example Distribution

Given:

- **Pool A:** $300 in staked tokens
- **Pool B:** $700 in staked tokens
- **Total value:** $1,000

Distribution:

- Pool A receives **30%** (300 Ã· 1,000)
- Pool B receives **70%** (700 Ã· 1,000)

## Pool Mechanics

<Info>
**Pools update during:**
- Token deposits and withdrawals.
- Boosting.
- Claiming Points.
</Info>

### Reward Calculation

To calculate your earnings, use the following forumla:

```
SPs per block = (Your Stake / Pool Total Stake) x Pool Share
```

Where:

- **Your Stake:** Amount of tokens you've deposited in the pool.
- **Pool Total Stake:** Total amount of tokens deposited in the pool by all users.
- **Pool Share:** Number of SPs allocated to the pool per block.

<Tip>Points accumulate continuously while staking.</Tip>

## Boosts

Boosts are multipliers that enhance your earning power by increasing your effective stake. When you apply a boost:

- You choose **how many** of your staked tokens to boost.
- The boosted tokens earn **multiplied rewards**.
- Those tokens remain locked until the boost period ends.
- Unboosted tokens can still be withdrawn anytime.

### How Boosts Work

**Example:**

- You have staked 100 tokens in a pool.
- You apply a 2x boost to 50 of your tokens.
- Those 50 boosted tokens now count as 100 tokens (50 Ã— 2).
- Your remaining 50 tokens stay unboosted, counting as 50.
- Your total effective stake is now 150 tokens (100 from boosted + 50 from unboosted).
- This means a **50% increase** in point earnings.

<Warning>
**Important**
- Only the boosted portion of your stake is locked.
- You can boost different amounts of tokens with different multipliers.
- Boosts expire after their set duration.
- After expiration, tokens return to normal earning rate.
- You can withdraw previously boosted tokens once their boost expires.
</Warning>

## Example Calculations

### One Pool

- **Points per Block:** 10 SP
- **Pool Multiplier:** 1x
- **Token Price:** $2.00
- **Your Stake:** 100 tokens

After 10 blocks:

- **Total Points Generated:** 100 SP
- **Points per Share:** 1e18

<Note>**Your Earnings:** 100 SP</Note>

### Multiple Pools

**Two Pools:**

Values:

- **Pool A:** $300
- **Pool B:** $700

Per-Block Distribution:

- **Pool A:** 3 SP
- **Pool B:** 7 SP

<Note>
**10-Block Earnings**
- **Pool A User:** 30 SP
- **Pool B User:** 70 SP
</Note>

### Multiple Pools with Multipliers

As aforementioned, some pools can have a multiplier greater than 1. Here's how this works in practice:

**Two Pools (Base Values):**

- **Pool A:** $400 Ã— 3x multiplier = $1,200 effective value
- **Pool B:** $800 Ã— 1x multiplier = $800 effective value

<Tip>**Total System Value:** $1,200 + $800 = $2,000 effective value</Tip>

**Per-Block Distribution (10 SP total):**

- **Pool A:** ($1,200/$2,000) Ã— 10 SP = 6 SP per block
- **Pool B:** ($800/$2,000) Ã— 10 SP = 4 SP per block

<Note>
**10-Block Earnings**
- **Pool A User:** 6 SP Ã— 10 blocks = 60 SP
- **Pool B User:** 4 SP Ã— 10 blocks = 40 SP
</Note>

<Warning>
**Remember**
- Points generate continuously per block.
- Larger stakes yield more points.
- Boosts increase earnings but lock tokens.
- Unboosted tokens can be withdrawn.
</Warning>
