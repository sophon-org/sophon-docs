<Info>**Boosting** allows you to **"supercharge"** your deposit, letting you earn more **Sophon Points (SPs)** over time. By activating a boost, you increase your potential rewards, but it's important to understand the **commitment** involved.</Info>

## Key Points

- **Permanent Commitment:** The assets you use to activate a boost will be permanently committed. These assets are allocated to provide liquidity on the Sophon mainnet (an ‘ownerless’ liquidity position), contributing to the growth of the Sophon ecosystem.
- **LP Token Burning:** Any LP tokens created during this process will be burned and are no longer available.
- **Initial Boost Multiplier:** The starting boost multiplier is set at 5x, but it may change over time depending on factors such as community feedback, supply, and demand dynamics.

### Boost Lock-In

- **Fixed Multiplier:** Once you activate a boost with a specific multiplier, that multiplier is locked in for the duration of the boost. Even if the base multiplier changes in the future, your boost remains at the rate you initially selected.
- **Ongoing Benefits:** You will continue to benefit from the multiplier you chose at activation, regardless of any future adjustments to the base multiplier.

### Permanent Lock of Boosting Assets

- **Liquidity Commitment:** The assets used to activate your boost are permanently locked. They will be dedicated to providing liquidity on the Sophon mainnet, and you will not be able to withdraw them in the future.

## Activating Boosts

When depositing to a pool, you can choose to boost either a portion or the entirety of your deposit. Boosting is a strategic decision that enables you to earn more Sophon Points (SP) over time by accelerating your rewards on the boosted portion of your deposit.

### Boost Activation

When you activate a boost, you permanently allocate a portion of your deposited assets to increase your rewards.

Permanently committed deposits are allocated to provide liquidity on the Sophon mainnet, contributing to the overall growth of the Sophon ecosystem.

<Note>Once assets are allocated for boosting, they cannot be withdrawn. These assets are locked and used for liquidity purposes on the mainnet.</Note>

#### Partial or Full Boost

You can choose to boost either a portion or the entirety of your deposit. The more you boost, the greater the Sophon Points you will earn.

- **Full Boost:** If you boost your entire deposit, all your assets will earn Sophon Points at the accelerated rate.
- **Partial Boost:** You can choose to boost only a part of your deposit. For example, if you deposit **1000 BEAM** and boost **200 BEAM**, only the **boosted portion** (**200 BEAM**) will earn at an accelerated rate.

Example:

```plaintext
Deposit: 1000 BEAM
Boost: 200 BEAM
Remaining unboosted: 800 BEAM
Result: You will earn Sophon Points at a 5x rate for the 200 BEAM that are boosted,
while the remaining 800 BEAM will earn at the standard rate.
```

## Calculating Boosts

When you activate a boost, your boosted assets earn Sophon Points (SP) at an accelerated rate determined by the boost multiplier. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

**Boost Multiplier**

- The current boost multiplier is 5x. This means your boosted assets will earn Sophon Points at five times the rate of unboosted assets.

**Boosted Amount**

- The boosted amount is calculated by multiplying your boosted principal by the boost multiplier. This gives you the total boosted Sophon Points you will earn.

**Total Earning Power**

Your total earning potential is the sum of your unboosted deposit and the boosted amount. This represents the overall staking power used to calculate your SP earnings.

**Example: Boosting 200 BEAM with a 5x Multiplier**

Let’s walk through an example to illustrate how boosting works:

- **Deposit:** 1000 BEAM
- **Boosted Amount:** 200 BEAM (5x multiplier)

With the 5x boost multiplier, your boosted portion of 200 BEAM is amplified to a 1000 BEAM virtual stake (200 BEAM * 5).

<Note>Only the boosted portion contributes to the increased Sophon Points (SP) earnings, but the original unboosted deposit remains unchanged.</Note>

**Calculation of Total Earning Power:**

```markdown
Boosted Amount: 200 BEAM * 5 = 1000 BEAM virtual stake  
Unboosted Amount: 800 BEAM  
Total Earning Power: 800 BEAM (unboosted) + 1000 BEAM (boosted) = 1800 BEAM
```

As a result, your total staking power becomes **1800 BEAM** (800 unboosted + 1000 boosted). This means you will earn SP as though you had deposited **1800 BEAM**, even though you only deposited **1000 BEAM**.

<Warning>While you will earn SP as if you deposited **1800 BEAM**, only the unboosted portion (**800 BEAM**) will be available for withdrawal. The boosted portion (**200 BEAM**) is **locked** and committed for liquidity.</Warning>
