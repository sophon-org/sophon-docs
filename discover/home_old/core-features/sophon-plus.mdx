Sophon\+ is your unified rewards hub across the Sophon ecosystem. Unlike traditional loyalty programs that keep you locked into a single app, Sophon\+ recognizes and rewards your activity from apps across Sophon.

**How it works**

1. Visit the Sophon\+ page to discover missions from across the Sophon ecosystem
2. Complete missions to earn Plus Points that accumulate in your account
3. Exchange your Plus Points in the Reward Store for a variety of prizes - from tokens and in-game items to physical tech gadgets

**Season 1 Details**

Season 1 runs for 120 days, ending on 30th September 2025. When the season concludes, the current set of missions and rewards will be replaced with a fresh lineup.

<Note>
  **Important:** Plus Points do not transfer between seasons. Be sure to spend your points in the Reward Store before the season ends\!

**Redeeming Reward Item Notes**

- **Physical Items: **Delivery may take up to 6 weeks after Season 1 ends, depending on your location
