While we're still rolling out Sophon Account support across all our apps, there's a simple way to make sure you never miss out on rewards for your activity.

### Quick Setup Guide

1. Create your Sophon Account using a web3 wallet
2. Connect this same wallet when using any Sophon ecosystem app

That's all you need to do\! This ensures all your activity is properly tracked for:

- Earning Badges
- Completing Sophon\+ missions
- Seeing your complete Activity Feed

We're working to make this process even smoother in the future, but this simple step will keep everything connected until then.
