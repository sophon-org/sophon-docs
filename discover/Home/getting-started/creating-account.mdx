Sophon Account makes interacting with crypto as simple as using your favourite apps. It removes the typical web3 barriers while maintaining the security and ownership you deserve.

Creating a Sophon Account is easy - just go to the “Login” button in the top right of any page.

Behind the scenes, Sophon Account uses advanced account abstraction technology to create a secure, self-custodial wallet. This means:

- **Simple sign-in**: Use familiar methods like Google, Email, Discord, Telegram or X
- **No extensions needed**: Everything happens directly in the app you're using
- **Self-custodial security**: You maintain full ownership of your assets and data
- **Modular**: Install and remove modules that fits your daily needs.
- **Extra security**: Set guardians who can help you regain access in any scenario that led you to lose access to your account.

If you have an existing Web3 wallet, you can also use this to create and sign into your Sophon Account.

Sophon Account support is rolling out across the ecosystem and soon, your favourite apps on Sophon will let you sign in via Sophon Account in one click.
