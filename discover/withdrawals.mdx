One of the key benefits of farming with Sophon is **flexibility**—you can withdraw your deposited assets (excluding boosted portions) anytime during the farming period, and there’s no penalty for doing so.

## What Happens When You Withdraw?

- **Keep Your Earned SP:** All Sophon Points (SP) you've accumulated up to the moment of withdrawal are locked in and will still count toward your final SOPH reward allocation at the end of the Ethereum Mainnet farming period.
- **Stop Earning on Withdrawn Assets:** Once assets are withdrawn, they will no longer generate SP, so keep this in mind when planning your farming strategy.

<Note>Boosted portions of your deposit are permanently committed and cannot be withdrawn.</Note>
