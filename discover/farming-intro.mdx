The **Sophon Farm** is designed to allow users to contribute to Sophon's growth while earning rewards. It offers a great way to participate in the community and be rewarded for your contributions.

<Info>10% of the $SOPH token supply will be dedicated to early supporters through the Sophon Farm.</Info>

## How it Works

By depositing assets into farming pools (such as **ETH**, **BEAM**, and more), you will accumulate **Sophon Points (SP)** with every new block. The farm will initially be available on **Ethereum Mainnet**, followed by a second farming period on the **Sophon Mainnet**.

## Farming Period Token Distribution

- **Ethereum Mainnet Farming**: 6% of the total $SOPH token supply.
- **Sophon Mainnet Farming**: 4% of the total $SOPH token supply.
