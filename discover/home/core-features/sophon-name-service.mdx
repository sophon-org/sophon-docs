Your username is your digital identity in the Sophon universe - a simple ID that connects all your activities.

Instead of sharing a complex wallet address, people can find you, send you things, and recognize your contributions using a memorable name like [username].soph.id. It also serves as your profile url in Sophon Home.

**Claiming your Username**\
When you join, you can reserve a username for 14 days. At no extra cost, make it permanent by:

- Completing at least 4 transactions within the Sophon ecosystem
- Connecting at least one social account to your profile

**For Guardian NFT Holders** \
If you hold a Guardian NFT in the web3 wallet you use to create your Sophon Account, your username is pre-approved\! Just connect a social account to finalize your claim.
