**What is Human Check?**

Human Check is a quick liveness verification that uses your camera to confirm you're a real Sophon member, not a bot or automated system. It protects our most valuable rewards in Sophon\+ and keeps the ecosystem fair for everyone.

Once verified, you'll sign a secure message that works across the entire Sophon ecosystem - meaning other apps can recognize your verified status and offer you better experiences and exclusive opportunities.

**How It Works**

1. Enable your camera - Grant temporary camera access for verification
2. Follow simple prompts - Move your head as instructed on screen
3. Sign your attestation - Sign a secure message to confirm your verification

No photos or videos are saved. Only a secure digital signature is created to prevent duplicate submissions.

**Why We Use Human Check**

Keeping It Fair - By ensuring only real people can access exclusive rewards in Sophon\+, everyone competes on equal ground - and ensures no automated bots are gaming the system.
