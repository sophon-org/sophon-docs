<Warning>
**TLDR**

**Guardians** get **20%** of **total $SOPH supply**. Half comes automatically through **Full Node** delegation. To unlock your complete allocation, also delegate your membership to a **Light Node**. **Simple path to maximum rewards**.
</Warning>

<Info>
**Overview**
- The **total $SOPH supply** is **10 billion** (10,000,000,000)
- Rewards are distributed weekly over the course of **156 weeks** (3 years)
- You must **maintain active status** to **qualify for rewards** (meaning you have delegated your membership or memberships)
- **Minimum Uptime** is currently set at **60%**
- Full and Light Node operators might have set a **% commission**
- Guardian NFT claiming **auto-delegates** to the **current Full Node** (Sophon-managed), making you eligible for **half (50%)** of your pro-rata reward allocation
- To receive your **full 20% allocation**, delegate to both **Full Nodes** (automatic) *and* **Light Nodes** (manual)
- Delegating to a **Light Node** is easily done via the [Guardian App](https://guardian.sophon.xyz)
- Your **reward rate** will be **adjusted** if you **remove delegation** from **either Node Type**
</Info>

## Reward Formula

<Tip>
**Reward Calculation Methodology**

Below is how your weekly rewards are calculated based on your delegation status. As long as you maintain active delegation to **both Full and Light Nodes**, you'll earn your **pro-rata share** of the **20% token supply**.
</Tip>

```
Weekly Reward = (SOPH Total Supply × Allocation % × Your active NFT Memberships) ÷ (Total active NFT Memberships × Total Weeks)
```

<Note>
**Where**
- **Total Supply** = **10 billion** (10,000,000,000)
- **Allocation %** = **5%** for **Full Node Delegation** + **10%** for **Light Node Delegation** + **5% Bonus** for participating = **20% total**
- **Total Weeks** = **156** (3 years)
</Note>

## Full Nodes

A total of **5%** of the **$SOPH supply** is allocated to **active NFT delegations** to **Full Nodes**. This will be distributed proportionally over **3 years**, with approximately **0.032%** distributed weekly.

<Warning>
**Each Guardian Membership NFT** is **automatically delegated** to a **Full Node** when claimed.
</Warning>

<Info>
**Steps**
1. **Start with total supply:** 10 billion $SOPH
2. **Multiply by allocation:** 10 billion × 0.05
3. **Multiply by your delegated NFT memberships**
4. **Divide by** total active NFT memberships × 156 weeks
5. **Multiply by** (100 - operator commission)/100
</Info>

<Tip>
**IMPORTANT**

While there is only a single **Full Node** operated by Sophon, its commission is **ZERO**
</Tip>

**Example:**

- **You have:** 20 delegated memberships
- **Total active:** 80,000 memberships
- **Full Node** has **zero** commission

<Tip>
**Weekly Reward**
- **->** (10 billion **×** 0.05 **×** 20) **÷** (80,000 **×** 156)
- **->** 10 billion **÷** 12,480,000
- **Total: \~801 SOPH**
</Tip>

## Light Nodes

A total of **10%** of the **$SOPH supply** is allocated to **active NFT delegations** to **Light Nodes**. This will be distributed proportionally over **3 years**, with approximately **0.064%** distributed weekly.

<Info>
**Steps**
1. **Start with total supply:** 10 billion $SOPH
2. **Multiply by allocation:** 10 billion × 0.05
3. **Multiply by your memberships**
4. **Divide by** (total memberships × 156 weeks)
5. **Multiply by** (100 - operator commission)/100
</Info>

**Example:**

- **You have:** 10 delegated memberships
- **Total active:** 80,000 memberships
- A given **Light Node** operator sets a **3% commission**

<Tip>
**Weekly Reward**
- **->** (10 billion **×** 0.1 **×** 10) **÷** (80,000 **×** 156)
- **->** 10 billion **÷** 12,480,000
- **->** 801 **×** (100 **-** 3)/100
- **Total: \~777 SOPH**
</Tip>

## Extra Delegation Rewards

A total of **5%** of the **$SOPH supply** is allocated to **active delegated memberships** (regardless of being to a **Full Node**, **Light Node**, or **both**). This will be distributed proportionally over **3 years**, with approximately **0.032%** distributed weekly.

<Warning>**Memberships** that are **not active** for a given week will ***not*** receive the weekly reward.</Warning>

<Info>
**Steps**
1. **Start with total supply:** 10 billion $SOPH
2. **Multiply by allocation:** 10 billion × 0.05
3. **For single membership:** multiply by 1
4. **Divide by** (total memberships × 156 weeks)
</Info>

**Example:**

- **You have:** 1 delegated membership
- **Total active:** 80,000 memberships

<Tip>
**Weekly Reward**
- **->** (10 billion **×** 0.05 **×** 1) **÷** (80,000 **×** 156)
- **->** 500 million **÷** 12,480,000
- **Total: 40 SOPH**
</Tip>

## Operator Commission

> **Node Operators** (whether **Light** or **Full**) can set a **commission rate**. When they do, a **portion** of the **weekly rewards** is allocated to the **operator**, while the remainder is distributed **directly** to **active membership owners**.
