<Warning>
**TLDR**

**Guardians** get **20%** of **total SOPH supply**. Half comes automatically through **Full Node** delegation. To unlock your complete allocation, also delegate your membership to a **Light Node**. **Simple path to maximum rewards**.
</Warning>

<Info>
**Overview**
- The **total SOPH supply** is **10 billion** (10,000,000,000)
- Rewards are distributed weekly over the course of **156 weeks** (3 years)
- You must **maintain active status** to **qualify for rewards** (meaning you have delegated your membership or memberships)
- **Minimum Uptime** is currently set at **60%**
- Full and Light Node operators might have set a **% commission**
- Guardian NFT claiming **auto-delegates** to the **current Full Node** (Sophon-managed), making you eligible for **half (50%)** of your pro-rata reward allocation
- To receive your **full 20% allocation**, delegate to both **Full Nodes** (automatic) *and* **Light Nodes** (manual)
- Delegating to a **Light Node** is easily done via the [Guardian App](https://guardian.sophon.xyz)
- Your **reward rate** will be **adjusted** if you **remove delegation** from **either Node Type**
- Rewards will only be viewable as of **15/01/25** and claimable around the time of TGE (which should occur **End H1 2025**)

## Reward Formula

<Tip>
**Reward Calculation Methodology**

Below is how your weekly rewards are calculated based on your delegation status. As long as you maintain active delegation to **both Full and Light Nodes**, you'll earn your **pro-rata share** of the **20% token supply**.
</Tip>

```
Weekly Reward = (SOPH Total Supply × Allocation % × Your active NFT Memberships) ÷ (Total active NFT Memberships × Total Weeks)
```

<Note>
**Where**
- **Total Supply** = **10 billion** (10,000,000,000)
- **Allocation %** = **5%** for **Full Node Delegation** + **10%** for **Light Node Delegation** + **5% Bonus** for participating = **20% total**
- **Total Weeks** = **156** (3 years)
</Note>

## Full Nodes

A total of **5%** of the **SOPH supply** is allocated to **active NFT delegations** to **Full Nodes**. This will be distributed proportionally over **3 years**, with approximately **0.032%** distributed weekly.

<Warning>
**Each Guardian Membership NFT** is **automatically delegated** to a **Full Node** when claimed.
</Warning>

<Info>
**Steps**
1. **Start with total supply:** 10 billion SOPH
2. **Multiply by allocation:** 10 billion × 0.05
3. **Multiply by your delegated NFT memberships**
4. **Divide by** total active NFT memberships × 156 weeks
5. **Multiply by** (100 - operator commission)/100
</Info>

<Tip>
**IMPORTANT**

While there is only a single **Full Node** operated by Sophon, its commission is **ZERO**
</Tip>

**Example:**

- **You have:** 20 delegated memberships
- **Total active:** 80,000 memberships
- **Full Node** has **zero** commission

<Tip>
**Weekly Reward**
- **->** (10 billion **×** 0.05 **×** 20) **÷** (80,000 **×** 156)
- **->** 10 billion **÷** 12,480,000
- **Total: \~801 SOPH**
</Tip>

## Light Nodes

A total of **10%** of the **SOPH supply** is allocated to **active NFT delegations** to **Light Nodes**. This will be distributed proportionally over **3 years**, with approximately **0.064%** distributed weekly.

<Info>
**Steps**
1. **Start with total supply:** 10 billion SOPH
2. **Multiply by allocation:** 10 billion × 0.05
3. **Multiply by your memberships**
4. **Divide by** (total memberships × 156 weeks)
5. **Multiply by** (100 - operator commission)/100
</Info>

**Example:**

- **You have:** 10 delegated memberships
- **Total active:** 80,000 memberships
- A given **Light Node** operator sets a **3% commission**

<Tip>
**Weekly Reward**
- **->** (10 billion **×** 0.1 **×** 10) **÷** (80,000 **×** 156)
- **->** 10 billion **÷** 12,480,000
- **->** 801 **×** (100 **-** 3)/100
- **Total: \~777 SOPH**
</Tip>

## Extra Delegation Rewards

A total of **5%** of the **SOPH supply** is allocated to **active delegated memberships** (regardless of being to a **Full Node**, **Light Node**, or **both**). This will be distributed proportionally over **3 years**, with approximately **0.032%** distributed weekly.

<Warning>**Memberships** that are **not active** for a given week will ***not*** receive the weekly reward.</Warning>

<Info>
**Steps**
1. **Start with total supply:** 10 billion SOPH
2. **Multiply by allocation:** 10 billion × 0.05
3. **For single membership:** multiply by 1
4. **Divide by** (total memberships × 156 weeks)
</Info>

**Example:**

- **You have:** 1 delegated membership
- **Total active:** 80,000 memberships

<Tip>
**Weekly Reward**
- **->** (10 billion **×** 0.05 **×** 1) **÷** (80,000 **×** 156)
- **->** 500 million **÷** 12,480,000
- **Total: 40 SOPH**
</Tip>

## Operator Commission

> **Node Operators** (whether **Light** or **Full**) can set a **commission rate**. When they do, a **portion** of the **weekly rewards** is allocated to the **operator**, while the remainder is distributed **directly** to **active membership owners**.

# Reward Distribution

Rewards are calculated and distributed on a weekly basis, **every Wednesday at 00:00 UTC**. After calculation, our systems begin creating the reward stream for each destination. Bear in mind this process can take some time – it’s normal for rewards to appear later in the day on Wednesday.
Each reward stream has the following properties:
- A specific amount of SOPH
- A start date (that Wednesday at 00:00 UTC)
- A **90-day cliff** – the stream does not begin vesting during this period
- A **7-day vesting period** – meaning the rewards become fully available over the course of 7 days. For example, if you claim halfway through the vesting period (after 3.5 days), you’ll have access to half of your rewards. You don’t lose the rest – you’ll just need to wait the remaining 3.5 days for the full amount to vest. You can claim a stream as many times as you like until it is fully vested and claimed.

## Pre-TGE Rewards
All rewards accrued by Guardians and Operators before the SOPH TGE (i.e., from January 1st to May 27th) are made available on the TGE date according to the following properties:
- A specific amount of SOPH (the total rewards accrued during that period)
- A start date of May 28th at 00:00 UTC
- A **90-day lockup**
- A **1-second vesting period** – meaning once the 90-day cliff ends, the entire stream becomes immediately claimable.
