<Info>
  **Overview**

  * The total $SOPH supply is **10 billion** (10,000,000,000)

  * Rewards are distributed weekly over the course of **156 weeks** (3 years)

  * You must maintain **active status** to qualify for rewards, meaning, you delegated your membership(s)

  * Full and light node operators **might** have set a % commission

  * You should always delegate both to full and light nodes

  * Delegation to the only current Full node (managed by Sophon) happens automatically upon NFT claiming
</Info>

## Reward Formula

Your weekly rewards are calculated using this formula:

```
Weekly Reward = (SOPH Total Supply × Allocation % × Your active NFT Memberships) ÷ (Total active NFT Memberships × Total Weeks)
```

<Note>
  **Where**

  * **Total Supply** = 10 billion (10,000,000,000)

  * **Allocation %** varies (**5% for delegating to Full Nodes, 10% for delegating to Light Nodes, extra 5% if you did any of these delegations**)

  * **Total Weeks** = 156 (3 years)
</Note>

## Full Nodes

A total of **5%** of the $SOPH supply is allocated to active NFT delegations to Full Nodes. This will be distributed proportionally over **3 years**, with approximately **0.032%** distributed weekly.

<Info>
  **Steps**

  1. **Start with total supply:** 10 billion $SOPH

  2. **Multiply by allocation:** 10 billion × 0.05

  3. **Multiply by your delegated NFT memberships**

  4. **Divide by** total active NFT memberships × 156 weeks

  5. Multiply by (100 - operator commission)/100 - **IMPORTANT**: while there is only a single full node operated by Sophon, its commission is **ZERO**
</Info>

**Example:**

* **You have:** 20 delegated memberships

* **Total active:** 80,000 memberships

* Full Node has **zero** commission

<Tip>
  **Weekly Reward**

  * -> (10 billion × 0.05 × 20) ÷ (80,000 × 156)

  * -> 10 billion ÷ 12,480,000

  * **Total: \~801 SOPH**
</Tip>

## Light Nodes

A total of **10%** of the $SOPH supply is allocated to active NFT delegations to Light Nodes. This will be distributed proportionally over **3 years**, with approximately **0.064%** distributed weekly.

<Info>
  **Steps**

  1. **Start with total supply:** 10 billion $SOPH

  2. **Multiply by allocation:** 10 billion × 0.05

  3. **Multiply by your memberships**

  4. **Divide by** (total memberships × 156 weeks)

  5. Multiply by (100 - operator commission)/100
</Info>

**Example:**

* **You have:** 10 delegated memberships

* **Total active:** 80,000 memberships

* A given Light Node operator set a 3% commission

<Tip>
  **Weekly Reward**

  * -> (10 billion × 0.1 × 10) ÷ (80,000 × 156)

  * -> 10 billion  ÷ 12,480,000

  * -> 801 X (100-3)/100

  * **Total: \~777 SOPH**
</Tip>

## Extra delegation rewards

A total of **5%** of the $SOPH supply is allocated to active delegated memberships (regardless of being to a full node, light node, or both). This will be distributed proportionally over **3 years**, with approximately **0.032%** distributed weekly.

<Warning>Memberships that are **not active** for a given week will not receive the weekly reward.</Warning>

<Info>
  **Steps**

  1. **Start with total supply:** 10 billion $SOPH

  2. **Multiply by allocation:** 10 billion × 0.05

  3. **For single membership:** multiply by 1

  4. **Divide by** (total memberships × 156 weeks)
</Info>

**Example:**

* **You have:** 1 delegated membership

* **Total active:** 80,000 memberships

<Tip>
  **Weekly Reward**

  * -> (10 billion × 0.05 × 1) ÷ (80,000 × 156)

  * -> 500 million ÷ 12,480,000

  * **Total: 40 SOPH**
</Tip>

## Operator commission

As stated, node operators (Light or Full) can define a commission. When they do so, a percentage of the weekly rewards are sent to the operator, and the remaining rewards directly to active membership owners.
