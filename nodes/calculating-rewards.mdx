<Warning>
**TLDR**
- **Guardians** receive **20%** of **total $SOPH supply**
- **10%** comes automatically from **Full Node Delegation**
- **Additional 10% unlocked** by **Light Node Delegation**
- You should delegate to **both Node Types** to maximize your rewards
</Warning>

<Info>
**Overview**

- Rewards are distributed weekly over the course of **156 weeks** (3 years)
- You must **maintain active status** to **qualify for rewards** (meaning you have delegated your membership or memberships)
- **Minimum Uptime** is currently set at **60%**
- Full and Light Node operators might have set a % commission
- Guardian NFT claiming auto-delegates to the **current Full Node** (Sophon-managed), making you eligible for **half (50%)** of your pro-rata reward allocation
- To receive your **full 20% allocation**, delegate to both **Full Nodes** (automatic) *and* **Light Nodes** (manual)
- Delegating to a **Light Node** is easily done via the [Guardian App](https://guardian.sophon.xyz)

## Reward Formula

<Tip>
**Reward Calculation Methodology**

Below is how your weekly rewards are calculated based on your delegation status. As long as you maintain active delegation to **both Full and Light Nodes**, you'll earn your **pro-rata share** of the **20% token supply**.
</Tip>

```
Weekly Reward = (Total Supply × Allocation % × Your Memberships) ÷ (Total Memberships × Total Weeks)
```

<Note>
**Where**
- **Total Supply** = 10 billion (10,000,000,000)
- **Allocation %** = **5%** for **Full Node Delegation** + **10%** for **Light Node Delegation** + **5% Bonus** for participating = **20% total**
- **Total Weeks** = 156 (3 years)
</Note>
