<Accordion title="What is the difference between a full and a light node?">
  A Sophon Full Node is a complete node that stores a full copy of the blockchain and can serve as either a sequencer or a validator. Sophon Light Nodes offer a more cost-effective way to participate in the Sophon network as they require less data run and support the network, generally helping with data availability sampling.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do node rewards work?">
  20% of supply are emitted over 36 month to Node operators. Node rewards are distributed weekly throughout this period. Ensure that you maintain the minimum uptime requirements to be eligible.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What uptime is required to get weekly rewards?">
  Currently you need to maintain at least 60% uptime over the week to receive rewards. This requirement may be updated over time.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is an operator address?">
  An operator address is the onchain identity for a node. It is used to receive Guardian Membership delegations from your own accounts or other peers on the network.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Where do I find and configure my operator address?">
  If you use Easeflow or another Node as a Service (NaaS) platform, they will generally take care of all of this for you automatically. If you are deploying your node via Railway/Docker, you'll need to set the operator address. It can be any standard Ethereum-based address, but we recommend you use a different wallet to the one holding your Guardian Membership NFTs.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Where can I monitor my nodes?">
  You can access the Node Dashboard via the [Guardian App](https://guardian.sophon.xyz/) by connecting the wallet that holds the Guardian Membership NFT.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I claim rewards?">
  The Dashboard in the [Guardian App](https://guardian.sophon.xyz/) contains an overview of rewards and what is available to claim. Click "Claim Rewards" when you have an available balance to redeem to your wallet.

<Accordion title="My node is status shows an error, what does this mean?">
  This means that your node is not currently reporting as active to the Sophon network. You may need to restart or reconfigure your node to bring it back online.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is required to run a node?">
  You need to own a Guardian Membership NFT, this acts as a licence to support the network. Deploying a node can be straightforward if you are using Easeflow or Railway as they take care of all the setup and hardware requirements.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I am running a node through Docker, what are the hardware requirements?">
  - **Minimum:** 512 MB, 2 core.
  - **Recommended:** 1 GB, 4 core.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I buy a node?">
  The Sophon node sale was held on 30th April 2024 and concluded shortly after. You can find more details on the sale [here](/nodes/details). The unsold supply has been burnt and there are no plans for further node sales.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Are nodes transferrable?">
  For the first 12 months, Guardian Membership NFTs are non-transferrable from the wallet they are redeemed to.
