## General Information About Nodes

<Accordion title="Who can run a node?">
  Anyone can run a **Light Node** and earn a % commission from members who delegate their Guardian NFTs to them.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What do you need to run a node?">
  Deploying a Light Node is simple if you use [Easeflow](https://easeflow.io/) or [Railway](https://railway.com/) as they take care of all the setup and hardware requirements. For more info, see [Light Nodes](/nodes/light-nodes).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is the difference between a Full and a Light Node?">
  A Sophon **Full Node** is a complete node that stores a full copy of the blockchain and can serve as either a sequencer or a validator.
  
  Sophon **Light Nodes** offer a more cost-effective way to participate in the Sophon network as they require less data run and support the network, generally helping with data availability sampling.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I am running a node through Docker, what are the hardware requirements?">
  - **Minimum:** 512 MB, 2 core.
  - **Recommended:** 1 GB, 4 core.
</Accordion>

## Node Setup and Configuration

<Accordion title="What is an operator address?">
  An operator address is the onchain identity for a node. It is used to receive Guardian Membership delegations from your own accounts or other peers on the network.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Where do I find and configure my operator address?">
  If you use **Easeflow** or another Node as a Service (NaaS) platform, they will generally take care of all of this for you automatically.
  
  If you are deploying your node via **Railway/Docker**, you'll need to set the operator address. It can be any standard Ethereum-based address, but we recommend you use a different wallet to the one holding your Guardian Membership NFTs.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Where can I monitor my nodes?">
  You can access the Node Dashboard via the [Guardian App](https://guardian.sophon.xyz/) by connecting the wallet that holds the Guardian Membership NFT.
</Accordion>

## Node Operations

<Accordion title="How do I retrieve all nodes' information?">
  <>
    <p>To retrieve all nodes' information, you can use the following command:</p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        {`curl -X GET "https://monitor.sophon.xyz/nodes"`}
      </code>
    </pre>
  </>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I retrieve my node information?">
  <>
    <p>
      You can retrieve your node information by filtering nodes using the <strong>operators</strong> filter. 
      It takes comma-separated addresses. Hereâ€™s an example:
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        {`curl -X GET "https://monitor.sophon.xyz/nodes?operators=0xOPERATOR1,0xOPERATOR2"`}
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      Additionally, you can define the <strong>page</strong> and <strong>per_page</strong> parameters. For example:
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        {`curl -X GET "https://monitor.sophon.xyz/nodes?page=3&per_page=10"`}
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      This will return **10 nodes** per page, and the request will retrieve the 3rd page of results.
    </p>
  </>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What do I do in the event of a re-register issue?">
  <>
    <p>You can change your node's URL (or IP) and/or destination address using the following:</p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        {`curl -X PUT "https://monitor.sophon.xyz/nodes" \\
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
-H "Authorization: Bearer SIGNED_MESSAGE" \\
-d '{ "operator": "OPERATOR_ADDRESS", "url": "NEW_URL", "destination": "NEW_DESTINATION", "timestamp": TIMESTAMP}'`}
      </code>
    </pre>
  </>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I delete my node?">
  Registered nodes can not be deleted.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What uptime is required to get weekly rewards?">

## Troubleshooting and Additional Questions

<Accordion title="My node's status shows an error, what does this mean?">
  This means that your node is not currently reporting as active to the Sophon network. You may need to restart or reconfigure your node to bring it back online.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I sign the authorization message?">
  The signed message is a UNIX timestamp (in seconds format) signed with your operator wallet. Signatures expire after 15 minutes.

  You can use [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/verifiedSignatures#) to sign messages.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I buy a node?">
  The Sophon node sale was held on 30th April 2024 and concluded shortly after. You can find more details on the sale [here](/nodes/details). The unsold supply has been burnt and there are no plans for further node sales.
</Accordion>
