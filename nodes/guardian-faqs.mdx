## Claiming Your Guardian Membership

<Accordion title="When can I claim my Guardian Membership?">
  The claiming window opens on December 18, 2024, and remains open after the January 1st rewards accrual start date.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I transfer my NFT after claiming?">
  The guardian membership is not transferable in the first year after minting, so please make sure you claim it to the wallet you want to have it for the first 365 days.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How does the 1-year NFT transfer restriction work, and when does it begin?">
  When claiming your Guardian NFT, you can choose any destination wallet to receive it. The 1-year transfer restriction begins from this initial claim. However, this doesn't affect node operations - you can delegate your NFT to any address that will operate the node, which can be the same as your holding wallet or a different one. This delegation system ensures flexible node operations while maintaining the transfer restriction.
