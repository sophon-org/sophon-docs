<Warning>
**Important**
- Anyone can set up and run a **Light Node**.
- Node Operators set a **% commission** (usually 1% - 3%).
- **Guardian Membership NFTs** allow members to earn their [full rewards allocation](/nodes/calculating-rewards) (20% of total $SOPH supply).
- Light Node Operators **without a Guardian NFT** only earn a % commission from the rewards of members who delegate their NFTs to them.
- Light Node Operators **with a delegated Guardian NFT** can earn $SOPH rewards as well as a % commission from their delegators’ rewards.
</Warning>

**Sophon Light Nodes** present the more cost-effective option for participating in the Sophon network.

Currently, they are responsible for performing **data availability sampling** - a critical step for a Validium to ensure all data is accessible, enabling the reconstruction of the chain state at any time.

<Tip>**Sophon Light Nodes** will continue to evolve in order to carry out more work within the Sophon network.</Tip>

# Deploying a Light Node for the Sophon Network

Deploying a Light Node is one of the most accessible ways to help maintain the Sophon Network. Light Nodes are easy to set up, require minimal resources, and are suitable for anyone with basic knowledge of technology, engineering, or DevOps.

## System Requirements

| **Component**                    | **Minimum** | **Recommended** |
| -------------------------------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| **RAM**                          | 512 MB      | 1 GB            |
| **CPU (amd64/x86 architecture)** | 2 cores     | 4 cores         |

<Note>You don’t need to deploy a node yourself if you don’t want to. You can use a **Node-as-a-Service (NaaS)** provider that supports Sophon Light Nodes, or leverage the [Guardians app](https://guardian.sophon.xyz) for a one-click setup with a provider.</Note>

### Current Node as-a-Service (NaaS) Providers

- [Easeflow](https://easeflow.io)
- [NodeOps](https://console.nodeops.xyz/deployNode/sophon)
- [NodeLayer](https://app.nodelayer.network/deploy/sophon-light-mainnet)
- **Additional providers coming soon!**

## Deployment Options

### Easiest Path: Railway

We provide a [Railway template](https://railway.app/template/wEhaxi?referralCode=qB-i6S) for automatic deployment. This method simplifies the process and provides you with full control of your light node.

**Steps:**

1. Visit the [Railway template](https://railway.app/template/wEhaxi?referralCode=qB-i6S).
2. Follow the guided instructions within Railway to deploy your environment.
3. Once complete, your Light Node will be up and running.

### For Tech-Savvy Users

If you prefer to manage your own environment, use our Docker files to deploy your Light Node:

- **Docker Hub:** [Sophon Light Node](https://hub.docker.com/r/sophonhub/sophon-light-node)
- **GitHub Repository:** [Sophon Light Node Repository](https://github.com/sophon-org/sophon-light-node)

**Steps:**

1. Download the **Docker files** from the links above.
2. Follow the provided **instructions** to configure and run the light node.
3. Customize **configurable variables** as needed for your setup.

## **Monitoring Your Light Node**

Regardless of how you deploy your Light Node, you can use the [Guardians app](https://guardian.sophon.xyz) to:

- Monitor the status of your node.
- Track rewards and performance.

<Note>This dashboard ensures you stay informed about your node’s operational state and contributions to the **Sophon Network**.</Note>
