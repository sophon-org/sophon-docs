A **Sophon Full Node** is a complete node that stores a full copy of the blockchain and can serve as either a sequencer or a validator.

- During the initial phase of the network, only **one node**, operated by Sophon Labs, is authorized to submit batches.
- However, efforts are underway to allow **multiple nodes** to collaborate through a consensus mechanism, adhering to the relevant network criteria, which will further decentralize block creation.

<Tip>At present, you can only run a **read-only** version of the Full Node.</Tip>

## High-level Overview

At a high level, the Full Node consists of the following modules:

- **API Server:** Provides the publicly available Web3 interface
- **Synchronization Layer:** Interacts with the main node and retrieves transactions and blocks to re-execute
- **Sequencer Component:** Executes and persists transactions received from the synchronization layer
- **Checker Modules:** Ensure the consistency of the ZKsync node state

### Capabilities and Limitations

With the **Full Node**, you can:

- Locally recreate and verify the Sophon mainnet/testnet state
- Interact with the recreated state in a trustless way
- Use the Web3 API without querying the main node
- Send L2 transactions (proxied to the main node)

However, the **Full Node** cannot:

- Create L2 blocks or L1 batches independently
- Generate proofs
- Submit data to L1

## Running a Full Node

The process of running a **Full Node** on Sophon is identical to running one on ZKsync Era. The node can be initialized in two modes:

- Recovery from a **DB dump** (equivalent to an Ethereum archival node)
- Recovery from a **snapshot** (equivalent to an Ethereum light node)

<Tip>
For local testing, we recommend setting up an in-memory node and forking mainnet using the [ZKsync CLI](../build/interact/zksync-cli).

<Note>
For detailed info on how to run, configure, and maintain a **Full Node**, see [ZKsync's docs](https://matter-labs.github.io/zksync-era/core/latest/guides/external-node/01_intro.html)
