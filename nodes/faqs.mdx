<Accordion title="When can I claim my Guardian Membership?">

<Accordion title="Who needs to complete KYC?">
  Direct sale participants need to complete KYC through guardian.sophon.xyz.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if I purchased through a partner platform?">
  If you participated in the Sophon node sale through launchpad partners, your KYC will be handled by those platforms. Please wait for specific instructions from your respective platform prior to December 18th.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I bought nodes with several wallets. How do I complete KYC for all of them?">
  First, complete KYC with your first wallet. Once approved, return to Blockpass and change the connected wallet. This will initiate a new KYC process for the new wallet. Repeat this process until all your wallets are allowlisted.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I transfer my NFT after claiming?">
  The guardian membership is not transferable in the first year after minting, so please make sure you claim it to the wallet you want to have it for the first 365 days.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I bought one node directly from Sophon and another via a partner platform using the same wallet. How do I handle KYC?">
  For nodes purchased directly from Sophon, complete KYC and claim through guardian.sophon.xyz. For nodes purchased through launchpads, follow the specific instructions provided by that platform.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I purchased a node but my wallet is not being accepted on the site.">
  If you bought your node through a third-party platform, they are responsible for performing KYC. On the claim date, they will send the NFT directly to your wallet.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why is my ID being blocked when my country isn't excluded?">
  We are investigating this issue with Blockpass and it should be resolved soon.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is there an end date for KYC?">
  KYC will remain available throughout the first year while NFTs can be claimed.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How does the 1-year NFT transfer restriction work, and when does it begin?">
  When claiming your Guardian NFT, you can choose any destination wallet to receive it. The 1-year transfer restriction begins from this initial claim. However, this doesn't affect node operations - you can delegate your NFT to any address that will operate the node, which can be the same as your holding wallet or a different one. This delegation system ensures flexible node operations while maintaining the transfer restriction.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I purchased nodes but later discovered my country is prohibited from KYC.">
  Please attempt to complete the KYC process on Blockpass to register your case, then email [kyc@sophon.xyz](mailto:kyc@sophon.xyz) with your full name and situation. We will reach out to assist you.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Where can I find the list of restricted jurisdictions?">
  The complete list is available on the guardians site and within the Blockpass KYC process.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Who has access to my KYC information?">
  A limited number of Sophon personnel have access, following industry standards, and only access the information if required for regulatory purposes. Blockpass, our KYC provider, automates most validation and only manually checks data when necessary.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What should I do if my verification documents are stuck in the queue?">
  If your documents are showing as "in queue for verification," please contact Blockpass support directly for assistance.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I complete KYC while traveling outside my home country?">
