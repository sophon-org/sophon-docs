SOPH is the main utility token for the Sophon Network, playing an essential role in its current and future operations.

We expect the utility to evolve over time as our network and our product offering grows, incorporating new utilities as we do. There is plenty planned on the product front so stay tuned for the evolution of SOPH.

There are two reasons SOPH is native to Ethereum. The first is that the ZK Stack only support chains with a base token that exists on L1. The second is that we are an L2, relying on L1 security, and it is therefore important for our community to have L1 backed security for their SOPH.

At launch SOPH serves two purposes. It is used to pay gas fees on the network and to facilitate the decentralisation of Sophon's sequencer using a staking mechanism.
