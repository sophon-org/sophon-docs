All transactions on the Sophon Network will be paid for in gas.

This does not necessarily require all users to hold SOPH due to ZKsync’s native paymaster technology.  Paymasters are a type of specialised account designed to subsidize or customize transaction fees for other accounts, providing a seamless user experience and greater flexibility. That means, no more being forced to bridge whenever you run out of the native gas token and depending on what you’re doing, maybe no gas to be paid at all. Check out our [Paymaster page](/architecture/paymasters) for more detail.

With all gas being paid in SOPH, either by the network, the user or the dapp, the token is redistributed to those operating the chain, which brings us onto the next utility.
