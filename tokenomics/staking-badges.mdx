Badges will be awarded to eligible airdrop recipients based on whether they stake their airdrop or not. These badges will be featured on your Sophon profile and may entitle you to future benefits within the Sophon ecosystem!

## Badge Tiers

There are three tiers of badges: Bronze, Silver and Gold.

### ðŸ¥‡ Gold Badge

Stake more than **75%** of your airdrop, with a total staked value equal to or greater than **250,000 SOPH** tokens.

### ðŸ¥ˆ Silver Badge

Stake more than **75%** of your airdrop.

### ðŸ¥‰ Bronze Badge

Stake more than **50%** of your airdrop.

<Note>

Only airdrop recipients are eligible for Staking badges. This applies to users that received their airdrop in their OKX account â€“ you will need to stake using the wallet that was originally eligible for the airdrop.

If your airdrop value is too low to qualify for the gold tier, users are able to acquire more SOPH and stake it in order to qualify for the Gold badge. For instance, if your airdrop is 200,000 SOPH and you acquire and stake an additional 50,000 SOPH you will receive the gold badge. Silver and Bronze badges are only contingent on the airdrop amount that you receive.

Eligible users are required to stake assets within the airdrop claim window (27th July 2025) and maintain their stake for at least a 3 month period after the claim window closes. Upon completion of the time frame badges will be distributed based on the percentage of your airdrop staked and the total amount staked.
