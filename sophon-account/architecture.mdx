The Sophon Account utilizes native account abstraction, creating smart contract accounts for users, offering enhanced security and flexibility compared to traditional Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs).

Key Features:

- **Modularity**: The Sophon account is designed on top of (EIP-7579)[https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7579], which bring the concept of modular accounts, where you can install and remove modules providing extra functionality to it.
- **EOA + Web 2 Signers**: Users can sign using regular EOAs. This makes easy for existing EOA users to be onboarded, but also enable to use use services that provide Web 2 logins (Google, Apple, Email, etc), running backend services with secured private keys as signers.
- **Passkey Signers**: Incredible UX for users with enhanced security of passkeys.
- **Session Keys**: Enable temporary permissions for specific actions or dApps.
- **Guardians**: Users can define guardians, who have permissions to reset the signers of an account, in the case of losing access to a passkey for example. The users themselves could set a hardware (cold) wallet they own as a Guardian.

## Architecture

To create a Sophon account, the user needs to provide a login method. This can be an email, a social login (Google, Apple, etc.), a Passkey, or an existing EOA.

Each login method associated with the Sophon account must, in turn, be associated with an embedded wallet signer in order to sign transactions.

These signers, along with passkeys or EOA signers, are then associated with a smart contract account deployed on the Sophon network.
