The Sophon Account utilizes native **Account Abstraction**, creating smart contract accounts for users, offering enhanced security and flexibility compared to traditional **Externally Owned Accounts** (EOAs).

Key Features:

- **Modularity**: The Sophon account is designed on top of [EIP-7579](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7579), which bring the concept of modular accounts, where you can install and remove modules providing extra functionality to it.
- **EOA + Web 2 Signers**: Users can sign using regular EOAs. This makes easy for existing EOA users to be onboarded, but also enable to use use services that provide Web 2 logins (Google, Apple, Email, etc), running backend services with secured private keys as signers.
- **Passkey Signers**: Incredible UX for users with enhanced security of passkeys.
- **Session Keys**: Enable temporary permissions for specific actions or dApps.
- **Guardians**: Users can define guardians, who have permissions to reset the signers of an account, in the case of losing access to a passkey for example. The users themselves could set a (cold) hardware wallet they own as a Guardian.
