title: "Data Scopes"
---

<Warning>
  Tokens are accessible only when using the React and React Native SDKs with a
  valid `partnerId`. Partners integrating via EIP-6963 will not have access to
  user tokens.
</Warning>

As an authentication provider, Sophon Account is able to provide a list of data scopes that the user can grant to the application.
You are required to specify the data scopes that you want to request from the user when you are initializing the SDK Context Provider.

The available scopes right now are:

- `email`
- `x`
- `gmail`
- `discord`
- `telegram`

The user has the option to grant or not to grant the scopes to the application during the authentication process.

To use it in code, you can do the following:

```typescript Requesting Data Scopes
import { DataScopes } from "@sophon-labs/account-core";
import { SophonContextProvider } from "@sophon-labs/account-react-native";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <SophonContextProvider
      partnerId="$YOUR_PARTNER_ID"
      dataScopes={[DataScopes.email, DataScopes.x]}
      network="testnet"
    >
      {/* Your components*/}
    </SophonContextProvider>
  );
}
```

Then you will have the scopes available in the user JWT token, and fetch the info in the backend. For more information, please check the [JWT & Access Tokens](./access-tokens) documentation.
