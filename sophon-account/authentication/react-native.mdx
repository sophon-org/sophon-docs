<Warning>
  Because of how **React Native** libraries work, you will need to install
  dependencies that have native code directly in your app so that we can use
  them.
</Warning>

You can add support for Sophon Account in your React Native application by using the `@sophon-labs/account-react-native` package.

## Installation

Before you start, you need these libraries:

```sh
# Passkey requirements
npm install @simplewebauthn/browser @simplewebauthn/server

# Pollyfills
npm install expo-crypto expo-standard-web-crypto \
  react-native-url-polyfill text-encoding-polyfill

# Overall native requirements
npm install expo-network react-native-mmkv react-native-webview
```

After that, you are ready to install our SDK:

```sh
# Sophon Library
npm install @sophon-labs/account-react-native
```

## Usage

Before anything, you need to wrap your application with `SophonContextProvider`, that will store context information about the accoint and walletClient connection.

```ts
import { SophonContextProvider } from "@sophon-labs/account-react-native";

export default function RootLayout() {
  // ...

  return (
    <SophonContextProvider network="testnet">
      {/* Your components*/}
    </SophonContextProvider>
  );
}
```

With that ready, you can now use our hooks to interact with Sophon.

```ts
import { useSophonAccount } from "@sophon-labs/account-react-native";

export default function YourComponent() {
  const { connect, account } = useSophonAccount();
  // ...
}
```
