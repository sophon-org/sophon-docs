## What is the Sophon Account?

The **Sophon Account** is a cross-application smart contract account designed to enhance the user experience across the [Sophon ecosystem](/build/partners/overview). Built on Sophon's native **Account Abstraction**, it allows users to interact seamlessly with decentralized applications (dApps) using familiar login methods such as email, social accounts, or existing EOA wallets without needing to re-authenticate on each supported application.

By leveraging Sophon's infrastructure, the wallet ensures a secure and smooth onboarding, making it easy even for non crypto native users to engage with the decentralized world.
