## What is the Sophon Account?

The **Sophon Account** is a cross-application smart contract account designed to enhance the user experience across the Sophon ecosystem. Built on Sophon's native account abstraction, it allows users to interact seamlessly with decentralized applications (dApps) using familiar login methods such as email, social accounts, or existing EOA wallets without needing to re-authenticate on each supported application.

By leveraging Sophon's infrastructure, the wallet ensures a secure and smooth onboarding, making it easy even for non crypto native users to engage with the decentralized world.

## Getting Started with Sophon Account

To initialize a new project with the Sophon Account:

```bash
