title: "Revoke a session key"
description: ""
---

If you ever feel like a session key is no longer needed, you can revoke it by calling <Tooltip tip="https://github.com/sophon-org/sophon-account/blob/main/packages/account-core/src/sessionHelper.ts#L160">[getRevokeSessionTxForViem](https://github.com/sophon-org/sophon-account/blob/main/packages/account-core/src/sessionHelper.ts#L160)</Tooltip> function.

<Info>
    The function will return a transaction that you can sign and send to the network. It requires the session hash and the address of the EOA account that is the target of the session key.
</Info>


```typescript
  const tx = await sophonAccount.getRevokeSessionTxForViem({
        sessionHash,
      }, address);
```

<Note>
  Check out the exact contract function implementation in the [Zksync SSO contract](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-sso-clave-contracts/blob/main/src/validators/SessionKeyValidator.sol#L157).
</Note>

After revoking the session key, the signer can no longer use it to execute the scoped actions.

<Note>
  Revoking a session key does not delete it from the blockchain. It only marks it as revoked.
  The session key will be marked as `Closed` in the `getSessionState()` function.

    ```typescript
    export enum SessionStatus {
        NotInitialized = 0,
        Active = 1,
        Closed = 2, //  <-- 
        Expired = 3,
    }
    ```
