## Getting Started with Sophon Account

The easiest way to get started with the Sophon Account is to use our EIP-6963 package, which allows you to use the Sophon Account in your web application by just importing a single package and using any wallet kit available in the market.

Its as simple as:

```bash Install the package as dependency
npm install @sophon-labs/account-eip6963
```

Then you need to import and initialize the [EIP-6963](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6963) emitter in your application entry point:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Dynamically" icon="diagram-project">
```javascript
import { createSophonEIP6963Emitter } from "@sophon-labs/account-eip6963";
createSophonEIP6963Emitter(process.env.NETWORK_KEY);

// The Sophon wallet will now announce itself via the EIP-6963 protocol
// No additional setup is required

````
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Statically Testnet" icon="vial">
```javascript
import "@sophon-labs/account-eip6963/testnet";

// The Sophon wallet will now announce itself via the EIP-6963 protocol
// No additional setup is required
````

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Statically Mainnet" icon="gem">
```javascript
import "@sophon-labs/account-eip6963/mainnet";

// The Sophon wallet will now announce itself via the EIP-6963 protocol
// No additional setup is required

````
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

This will automatically:

- Register the Sophon wallet provider
- Announce it through the [EIP-6963](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6963) events
- Make it available to [EIP-6963](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6963) compatible applications

### Working with Wallet Connection Libraries

Most modern wallet connection libraries, like RainbowKit, wagmi, or Reown Appkit, support [EIP-6963](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6963). Here's how to connect with wagmi:

```javascript
import { getDefaultConfig } from "@rainbow-me/rainbowkit";
import { sophonTestnet, sophon } from "wagmi/chains";
import { createSophonEIP6963Emitter } from "@sophon-labs/account-eip6963";

createSophonEIP6963Emitter("testnet");

export const config = getDefaultConfig({
  appName: "Your Application",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  chains: [sophon, sophonTestnet],
  ssr: true,
});
````

With this setup, the Sophon wallet will appear in the wallet selection UI provided by RainbowKit.

## Main Packages
