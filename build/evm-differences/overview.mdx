# Sophon and EVM Compatibility

Sophon is built on top of the ZK Stack framework, providing a [ZKSync VM](https://docs.zksync.io/zksync-protocol/vm) that offers strong compatibility with Ethereum while optimizing for ZK-proof generation.

## zkEVM: The Foundation of Sophon

Sophon's zkEVM is a specialized virtual machine designed to execute smart contracts while generating zero-knowledge proofs of execution. The zkEVM:

- Maintains compatibility with most Ethereum smart contracts
- Optimizes operations for efficient ZK-proof generation
- Extends functionality with features like paymasters and account abstraction

While the zkEVM is EVM compatible, the bytecode it executes differs from standard EVM bytecode, requiring specialized compilation and tooling.

## EVM Equivalence with v27 Upgrade

With the v27 upgrade, Sophon introduced an EVM Bytecode Interpreter that enables direct execution of unmodified EVM bytecode. This means developers can now:

- Deploy standard Solidity & Vyper contracts without recompilation
- Use familiar tools like Hardhat, Foundry, and Remix without plugins
- Benefit from the same contract address derivation as on Ethereum

For detailed information about how the EVM Bytecode Interpreter works, see the [EVM Interpreter](/build/evm-differences/evm-interpreter) page.

## Key Benefits

- **EVM Compatibility**: Most Ethereum smart contracts will work on Sophon
- **Familiar Development Tools**: Use the same development tools like Hardhat and Foundry
- **Extended Functionality**: Access to additional features like Paymasters
- **Dual Execution Models**: Support for both zkEVM native contracts and EVM bytecode contracts

## Getting Started

If you're unfamiliar with developing or deploying on ZK Stack, you can find comprehensive information in the [ZK Stack documentation](https://docs.zksync.io/), including a quickstart to [deploy your first contract](https://docs.zksync.io/zksync-era/guides/quick-start/deploy-your-first-contract).

For specific guides tailored to Sophon, see:
