# Troubleshooting Script Injection Issues

This guide helps you resolve common issues where JavaScript scripts work locally but fail to inject properly in production environments.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Scripts Working Locally but Not in Production

If your JavaScript scripts are working correctly in your local development environment but are not being injected in production, check the following:

1. **Build Configuration**
   - Ensure your build configuration properly includes the script files
   - Verify that the build process is correctly processing and bundling your scripts
   - Check if your production build settings differ from development settings

2. **Path References**
   - Confirm that script paths are correct for the production environment
   - Check if you're using absolute vs relative paths appropriately
   - Verify that the production server's file structure matches your expectations

3. **Environment Variables**
   - Verify that any required environment variables are properly set in production
   - Check if your script injection logic depends on environment-specific configurations

4. **Deployment Process**
   - Ensure all script files are included in your deployment package
   - Verify that file permissions are set correctly on the production server
   - Check if your deployment process is skipping or excluding any necessary files

5. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**
   - Check if your production environment has CSP rules that might be blocking script injection
   - Verify that your scripts comply with any existing CSP headers

## Quick Fixes

1. Clear your production build cache and rebuild
2. Double-check your build configuration files
3. Verify script paths in your production environment
4. Review your deployment logs for any errors

## Prevention Tips

- Always test script injection in a staging environment before deploying to production
- Use automated tests to verify script loading
- Implement proper error logging for script injection failures
- Document any environment-specific configuration requirements

If the above solutions don't resolve the issue, consider:
- Reviewing your bundler configuration
- Checking for any conflicts with other scripts or libraries
- Examining browser console errors in the production environment
- Verifying that your script injection method is production-ready
