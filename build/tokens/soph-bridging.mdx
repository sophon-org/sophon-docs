title: "SOPH Bridging"
mode: "wide"

## Overview

The SOPH token was minted on Ethereum mainnet and canonically bridged to Sophon as the native fee token. To enable seamless cross-chain functionality, we added an OFTAdapter (Omnichain Fungible Token Adapter) on Sophon that allows easy bridging to other supported chains.

## Technical Implementation

**Architecture:**
- **Ethereum Mainnet**: Original ERC20 token contract
- **Sophon**: Canonically bridged as the native fee token with an additional OFTAdapter for cross-chain bridging
- **Other Chains**: OFT (Omnichain Fungible Token) implementations that connect through LayerZero

This design ensures that SOPH maintains its native status on Sophon while providing users with the flexibility to bridge their tokens to other major blockchain networks for DeFi activities and broader ecosystem participation.

## Bridging Flow

- **Ethereum ↔ Sophon**: Use the canonical ZKsync bridge
- **Sophon ↔ Other Chains**: LayerZero OFT bridging
- **Ethereum ↔ Other Chain**: Currently not supported

<Note>We want to avoid having multiple SOPH addresses on the same chain</Note>

## Key Features

- **Native Fee Token**: SOPH serves as the native gas token on Sophon
- **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Seamless bridging to major blockchain networks
- **LayerZero Integration**: Leverages LayerZero's omnichain infrastructure for secure cross-chain transfers
- **Wrapped Version**: WSOPH available for DeFi applications requiring ERC-20 compatibility

## LayerZero OFT

To support the bridging with LayerZero, the OFT adapter and OFT tokens linked [above](#contract-addresses) were created.
- The adapters are owned by a Sophon Foundation Multisig on each chain, which only has permission to set delegates.
- The adapters' main delegate is also the same Sophon Foundation Multisig, and the delegate has permission to add new routes for new chains.

This structure doesn't give the Sophon Foundation any powers over the token itself.
The security of minting and burning is still ensured by the LayerZero protocol itself.
The foundation can just include new routes for new chains.

A script that shows and validates the configurations above (and the approval needed) can be found [here](https://github.com/sophon-org/sophon-oft/blob/main/layerzero.config.ts).
