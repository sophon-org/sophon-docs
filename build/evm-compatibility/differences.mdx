# zkVM vs EVM Differences

Sophon's native zkVM is fundamentally different from Ethereum's EVM as it's designed to generate zero-knowledge proofs while executing smart contracts. While the EVM Bytecode Interpreter enables EVM compatibility (see [limitations](/build/evm-compatibility/evm-interpreter#limitations)), here are the core differences between zkVM and EVM:

## Execution Model

- **Proof Generation**: zkVM operations must be ZK-proof friendly, affecting how certain operations work
- **Gas Model**: Uses "ergs" instead of gas, with different cost calculations for operations
- **State Management**: Different approach to handling state changes due to ZK-proof requirements

## EVM Instruction Differences

To check what opcodes differ in behavior between Sophon and Ethereum, see the official [EVM Instructions](https://docs.zksync.io/zksync-protocol/differences/evm-instructions) page.

## Native Features

### Account Abstraction

Unlike EVM which requires EIP-4337 for AA, Sophon's zkVM:

- Has native account abstraction built into the VM
- Provides better performance for AA operations
- Handles nonces differently for AA accounts

### Paymasters

zkVM has native support for paymasters:

- Built-in paymaster functionality
- More efficient fee abstraction
- Different gas accounting for sponsored transactions

### System Contracts

- Additional precompiled contracts specific to zkVM
- Different handling of system-level operations
- Native multi-transaction support

## State and Storage

### Nonce Handling

- Separate nonces for deployments and transactions
- Different nonce management for smart contract accounts
- Unique nonce behavior for batched transactions

### Storage Layout

- Different storage slot calculation
- Unique handling of immutable references
- Modified library linking process

## Contract Lifecycle

### Deployment

- Different bytecode format for native zkVM contracts
- Unique contract creation flow
- Modified CREATE/CREATE2 behavior for zkVM contracts

### Code Execution

- Different handling of contract calls
- Modified return data handling
- Unique error propagation model
