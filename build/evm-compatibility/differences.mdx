# Technical Differences

While Sophon provides EVM compatibility, there are important technical differences between native zkVM and EVM that developers should be aware of:

## Contract Deployment

- **L1-L2 Deployment**: EVM contracts can't be deployed directly via L1-L2 transactions (which require a `to` field)

## EVM Instructions

Some EVM opcodes function differently on Sophon:

- Certain operations related to code hashing return different values
- Contract self-destruction has implementation differences
- Contract creation has specific constraints

## Nonces

- Different nonce management for account abstraction
- Deployment nonce vs. transaction nonce

## Libraries

- Library linking works differently
- Immutable references implementation

## Precompiled Contracts

- Standard Ethereum precompiles
- Additional ZK-specific precompiles

## Account Abstraction

Sophon implements native account abstraction, which differs from EIP-4337:

- Native AA provides better performance
- Different implementation details

[Learn more about AA differences](https://docs.zksync.io/zksync-protocol/differences/native-vs-eip4337)

## Contract Deployment d

- Factory contract interactions
- CREATE/CREATE2 behavior
- Deployment gas costs
