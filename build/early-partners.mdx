As with any blockchain, you need the native token (**$SOPH** in our case) to interact with Sophon.

However, during the alpha stage, we won't distribute tokens for either Testnet or Mainnet. Instead, you'll interact with our Paymaster, which will sponsor your deployment transactions and interactions with your deployed contracts.

This approach eliminates the need for **$SOPH** tokens for both you and your users during the Alpha Stage.
