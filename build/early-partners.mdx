As with any blockchain, you need the native token (**SOPH** in our case) to interact with Sophon.

However, during the alpha stage, we won't distribute tokens for either Testnet or Mainnet. Instead, you'll interact with our Paymaster, which will sponsor your deployment transactions and interactions with your deployed contracts.

The Paymaster operates under the following rules:
- Only whitelisted addresses can deploy new contracts
- Any user can interact with contracts deployed by whitelisted addresses

This approach eliminates the need for **SOPH** tokens for both you and your users during the Alpha Stage.

Upon completing the onboarding process, please follow the [Hardhat](/build/interact/hardhat) or [Foundry](/build/interact/foundry) guides to deploy your contracts.
