To use Sophon, you'll need our native token (**SOPH**), just like with any blockchain.

## Gas Fees & Paymaster

<Warning>
  Since the SOPH TGE happened on May 28th, we'll be winding down our ecosystem-wide paymaster two
  weeks after the launch. Until then, our Paymaster will cover your deployment transactions and
  contract interactions.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  Gas costs for L1 to L2 native bridging and transactions done within Sophon Home will still be
  sponsored by us.
</Tip>

Here's how the Paymaster works:

- Only whitelisted addresses can deploy new contracts
- Anyone can interact with contracts deployed by whitelisted addresses

<Tip>
  Want to get on the allow list? Just fill out this [form](https://forms.gle/j3BTuHJUL2apBT8d9) and
  we'll reach out to help you get started. Deployments will still be permissioned to only
  whitelisted addresses.
</Tip>

  Curious about paymasters in general? Check out the [Paymasters](/architecture/paymasters) page for
  more details.

Once you're onboarded, you can follow our [Hardhat](/build/interact/hardhat) or [Foundry](/build/interact/foundry) guides to deploy your contracts.

## Set Up Your Own Paymaster

As a partner, you'll be able to run your own paymaster. This means you can sponsor your team's transactions and contract interactions, using your own rules and budgets.

Even after our paymaster sunsets, contract deployments will still be limited to whitelisted addresses.
