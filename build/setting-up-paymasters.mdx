## Creating Your Own Paymaster

You can create your own paymaster with your custom logic to subsidize users in multiple ways. For general information on paymasters, please refer to the [Paymasters](/architecture/paymasters) page.

### 1. Deploy via txSync

[txSync Tsuko](https://app.txsync.io/tsuko) offers everyone an easy way to create sponsored paymasters on Sophon and Sophon testnet. To create one, please follow our [walkthrough video](https://www.loom.com/share/bf5d2d2d774646eaa2aed3c71a822263?sid=7ba4d65f-465b-442e-b22a-30f52d75997d).

Via **txSync Tsuko**, you can:

- Top it up with **SOPH**
- Withdraw your **SOPH** from it at any time
- Monitor it (see usage)
- Add extensions

<Tip>
  It is important to restrict your paymasters to your target audience only to avoid unintended usage.
</Tip>

### Configure Your Restrictions

[txSync Tsuko](https://app.txsync.io/tsuko) extensions offer you a list of pre-built restrictions you can plug into your paymasters to filter transactions. This list includes:

- **User whitelisting**: specify which user addresses (EOAs) can send a transaction.
- **Contract whitelisting**: specify which contract addresses can be interacted with.
- **Function whitelisting**: specify both contracts AND functions from those contracts that can be interacted with.
- **NFT(ERC721) whitelisting**: exclusively authorize paymaster access for holders of a specific NFT collection on Sophon.

For more detail, check their detailed list [here](https://app.txsync.io/tsuko/restriction-catalog).

### 2. Deploy via Hardhat/Foundry

The [ZKsync contract templates](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-contract-templates/tree/main/templates/101/contracts/4-paymaster) repository has examples for both ERC20-based paymasters as well as sponsored(gasless) ones. If you are proficient with direct on-chain deployments, you can tailor these examples to your needs and deploy it following their respective [deployment templates](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-contract-templates/blob/main/templates/101/deploy/4-paymaster/gasless/deploy.ts).
