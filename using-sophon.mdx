As an EVM chain, Sophon will be readily available on every wallet interface and supported by [Metamask](https://metamask.io/), Rabby, Rainbow, and any other EVM wallet.

  </span>
</span>

To add the Sophon Network manually, follow these steps:

1. Open your browser wallet
2. Go to **Settings**
3. Click on **Add Network**
4. Fill in the following information in the relevant fields:

```html Network Information
Network Name: Sophon
RPC URL: https://rpc.sophon.xyz
Chain ID: 50104
Currency Symbol: SOPH
Block Explorer: https://explorer.sophon.xyz
WebSocket URL: wss://rpc.sophon.xyz/ws
```

<Check>After adding this, you are now ready to use **Sophon**.</Check>

### Bridging to Sophon

You can bridge to Sophon from Ethereum using the native bridge:

https://portal.sophon.xyz

<Note>The chain supports [LayerZero](https://layerzero.network/) as well.</Note>

### Interacting With Sophon

<Warning>Before using any app, make sure Sophon is set as the **active network**. While other wallets automatically switch to Sophon when interacting with its apps, [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) requires that you select it manually.</Warning>

1. Navigate to the top of your wallet pop-up.
2. Click on the drop-down menu.
3. Select the **Sophon Network**, and you should be good to go.
