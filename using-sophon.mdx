Follow these steps to begin:

### Connecting Your Wallet

As an EVM chain, Sophon will be readily available on every wallet interface and supported by Metamask, Rabby, Rainbow, and any other EVM wallet.

<span class="wallet-related">
  <span class="soph-button" onClick={() => connectWalletAndAddNetwork()}>
    <span>Add network to wallet</span>
  </span>
</span>

To add the Sophon Network manually, follow these steps:

1. Open your browser wallet
2. Go to **Settings**
3. Click on **Add Network**
4. Fill in the following information in the relevant fields:

```html Network Information
Network Name: Sophon
RPC URL: https://rpc.sophon.xyz
Chain ID: 50104
Currency Symbol: SOPH
Block Explorer: https://explorer.sophon.xyz
WebSocket URL: wss://rpc.sophon.xyz/ws
```

Once this is added, you are now ready to use Sophon.

### Bridging to Sophon

Bridge to Sophon from Ethereum using the native bridge:

https://portal.sophon.xyz

The chain supports [LayerZeo](https://layerzero.network/) as well.

### Interacting With Sophon

Before interacting with any app, ensure that Sophon is the current active network. With other wallets, this is done automatically when interacting with any Sophon app; however, with Metamask, you will need to do this manually.

1. Navigate to the top of your wallet pop-up.
2. Click on the drop-down menu.
3. Select the **Sophon Network**, and you should be good to go.
