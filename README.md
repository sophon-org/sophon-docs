# Mintlify Starter Kit

Click on `Use this template` to copy the Mintlify starter kit. The starter kit contains examples including:

- Guide pages
- Navigation
- Customizations
- API Reference pages
- Use of popular components

### üöÄ Development

Install the [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) to preview the documentation changes locally. To install, use the following command:

```bash
npm i -g mintlify
```

Run the following command at the root of your documentation (where `mint.json` is):

```bash
mintlify dev
```

This will start a local development server, allowing you to preview changes to your documentation.

### üåê Publishing Changes

Install our GitHub App to auto propagate changes from your repo to your deployment. Changes will be deployed to production automatically after pushing to the default branch. Find the link to install the app on your Mintlify dashboard.

### üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- **Mintlify dev isn't running**: Run `mintlify install`. This will re-install any missing dependencies.
- **Page loads as a 404**: Make sure you are running the command in a folder containing the `mint.json` file.
