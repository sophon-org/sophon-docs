Understanding the farming cycle is key to maximizing Sophon Points earned and participating in the broader Sophon ecosystem:

## Ethereum Mainnet

This is the initial phase during which users can deposit assets and earn Sophon Points. Sophon Points accrue until each asset is bridged to Sophon Mainnet. The duration of the farming period will be announced later.

## Sophon Mainnet

Upon the launch of Sophon Mainnet, all deposited assets will be permissionlessly transferred and immediately accessible. New deposits and boosts will be available on Sophon Mainnet as well, but previously boosted assets on Ethereum Mainnet will remain permanently locked for liquidity purposes. The accumulated Sophon Points will then be used to calculate rewards in $SOPH tokens based on the allocated percentage of the token supply.
