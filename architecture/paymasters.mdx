Paymasters are one of the main selling points of the zk stack. They can be used to make life easy for your users, enabling greater flexibility for Dapps and a seamless flow for their users.

## Benefits of Paymasters

The implementation of Paymasters significantly improves the user experience by offering various ways to subsidize or customize transaction fee payments. Some examples include:

- **Protocol Sponsorship:** A protocol can sponsor transaction fees for its users, incentivizing adoption and usage of the protocol.
- **Transaction Limits:** Limits can be set for specific users. For example, the top five users can receive 1,000 free transactions each, encouraging engagement and usage.
- **NFT-Based Fee Waivers:** An NFT can be created that allows holders to bypass paying transaction fees, adding value to the NFT while providing users with benefits.
- **Alternative Gas Payments:** Users can pay gas fees with an ERC-20 token other than SOPH, allowing for value accrual and expanding the range of token options for gas payment.

## How to create your own paymaster

You can create your own paymaster with your custom logic to subsidize users in multiple ways.

### Deploy via txSync

[txSync Tsuko](https://app.txsync.io/tsuko) offers everyone an easy way to create simple sponsored paymasters on Sophon and Sophon testnet. To create one, please follow our [walkthrough video](https://www.loom.com/share/bf5d2d2d774646eaa2aed3c71a822263?sid=7ba4d65f-465b-442e-b22a-30f52d75997d).

Via **txSync Tsuko**, you can do various things with your paymasters:

- Top it up with **$SOPH**
- Withdraw your **$SOPH** from it at any time
- Monitor it(see usage)
- Add extensions to it

<Tip>
  It is important to restrict your paymasters to your target audience only, elsehow anyone that knows the paymaster's address can use it.
</Tip>

### Configure your rescrictions

[txSync Tsuko](https://app.txsync.io/tsuko) extensions offer you a list of pre-built restrictions you can simply plug into your paymasters and also remove them at will. This list includes:

- **Contract whitelisting**(contract list based subsidizing): specify which contract addresses can use your Paymaster.
- **User whitelisting**(wallet list based subsidizing): specify which user addresses(EOAs) can use your Paymaster.
- **Function whitelisting**(function list based subsidizing): specify both contracts AND functions from those contracts to use your Paymaster. Any user calling these functions would be able to be subsidized by your Paymaster.
- **NFT(ERC721) whitelisting: **exclusively authorize paymaster access for holders of a specific NFT collection on Sophon.

For more detail, check their detailed list [here](https://app.txsync.io/tsuko/restriction-catalog).

### Deploy via hardhat/foundry

The [zkSync contract templates](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-contract-templates/tree/main/templates/101/contracts/4-paymaster) repository has examples for both ERC20-based paymasters as well as sponsored(gasless) ones. If you are proficient with direct on-chain deployments, you can tailor these examples to your needs and deploy it following their respective [deployment templates](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-contract-templates/blob/main/templates/101/deploy/4-paymaster/gasless/deploy.ts).

## Conclusion

Paymasters enable a flexible and user-friendly way to handle transaction fees within the ZKsync ecosystem. By allowing various payment models, they open up new possibilities for developers and users, making the ecosystem more accessible and appealing.
