Paymasters are one of the key features of ZK stack. They are a special type of smart contract that can pay the gas cost for a transaction, enabling greater flexibility for Dapps and a seamless experience for their users.

## Benefits of Paymasters

The implementation of Paymasters significantly improves the user experience by offering various ways to subsidize or customize transaction fee payments. Some examples include:

- **Protocol Sponsorship:** A protocol can sponsor transaction fees for its users, incentivizing adoption and usage of the protocol.
- **Transaction Limits:** Limits can be set for specific users. For example, the top five users can receive 1,000 free transactions each, encouraging engagement and usage.
- **NFT-Based Fee Waivers:** An NFT can be created that allows holders to bypass paying transaction fees, adding value to the NFT while providing users with benefits.
- **Alternative Gas Payments:** Users can pay gas fees with an ERC-20 token other than SOPH, allowing for value accrual and expanding the range of token options for gas payment.
