title: "Paymasters"
---

Paymasters are a new type of specialized account within the ZKsync ecosystem. These accounts are designed to subsidize transaction fees for other accounts, enabling greater flexibility and enhanced user experience. Paymasters allow fees to be paid using ERC-20 tokens other than ETH, which makes them well-suited for use with Sophon.

## Benefits of Paymasters

The implementation of Paymasters significantly improves the user experience by offering various ways to subsidize or customize transaction fee payments. Some examples include:

- **Protocol Sponsorship:** A protocol can sponsor transaction fees for its users, incentivizing adoption and usage of the protocol.
- **Transaction Limits:** Limits can be set for specific users. For example, the top five users can receive 1,000 free transactions each, encouraging engagement and usage.
- **NFT-Based Fee Waivers:** An NFT can be created that allows holders to bypass paying transaction fees, adding value to the NFT while providing users with benefits.
- **Alternative Gas Payments:** Users can pay gas fees with an ERC-20 token other than SOPH, allowing for value accrual and expanding the range of token options for gas payment.

## How to create your own paymaster

You can create your own paymaster with your custom logic to subsidize users in multiple ways.

### Deploy via txSync

[txSync Tsuko](https://app.txsync.io/tsuko) offers everyone an easy way to create simple sponsored paymasters on Sophon and Sophon testnet. To create one, please follow our [walkthrough video](https://www.loom.com/share/bf5d2d2d774646eaa2aed3c71a822263?sid=7ba4d65f-465b-442e-b22a-30f52d75997d).
