title: 'Native Account Abstraction'
description: ''
---

Account abstraction is widely regarded as a **revolutionary concept** in the crypto world due to its potential to greatly enhance the user experience. Let’s break it down step by step.

## Types of Ethereum Accounts

Ethereum currently supports 2 types of accounts:

### **1. Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs)**

These are the common hot wallets used to make onchain transactions.

- **Controlled by:** Private keys.
- **Functionality:**

  - Can send messages by creating and signing transactions.
  - Initiate onchain transactions directly.

- **Examples:**

  - [Rabby Wallet](https://rabby.io/)
  - [Metamask](https://metamask.io/)
  - [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet)

<Note>Whenever you initiate an onchain transaction, you are using an EOA.</Note>

### **2. Contract Accounts**

These accounts are governed by **smart contracts** and offer programmable logic.

- **Functionality:**

  - Can execute complex, custom-coded logic.
  - Can only create and send messages after receiving an initial message.

<Tip>Ideal for building applications that require custom behavior.</Tip>

### **The Ideal Solution**

The optimal account type would combine the flexibility of **Contract Accounts** with the direct usability of **EOAs**. Enter **Account Abstraction**.

## What is Account Abstraction?

The introduction of [EIP-4337](https://www.erc4337.io/docs) brought account abstraction to the Ethereum ecosystem.

### **EIP-4337: A Major Leap**

- Introduced **smart contract accounts** that:

  - Can **initiate and send transactions** like EOAs.
  - Incorporate **arbitrary logic** for more complex actions through a single account.

- Enabled features such as:

  - Custom signature schemes.
  - Native multi-signature capabilities.
  - Application-specific restrictions.

<Warning>Despite its technical advancements, EIP-4337 faces implementation issues due to its **complex infrastructure requirements** and **partial compatibility** with the Ethereum ecosystem.</Warning>

## Sophon's Approach to Account Abstraction

Sophon leverages **native account abstraction (AA)** built into ZKsync, offering significant advantages over Ethereum's **EIP-4337**. While both approaches aim to improve account flexibility and user experience, the **native AA** of ZKsync—and by extension Sophon—provides a seamless, efficient, and unified solution.

## Native AA vs. EIP-4337

### **1. Implementation Level**

**Sophon (ZKsync Native AA)**: Integrated directly at the **protocol level**, enabling a foundational, seamless experience.

**EIP-4337**: Operates outside the protocol as an overlay, avoiding protocol-level changes but introducing complexity.

### **2. Account Types**

**Sophon (ZKsync Native AA)**:

- All accounts, including EOAs, behave like **smart contract accounts** under the hood.
- **Paymasters** are supported natively for **all account types**.
- Smart contract accounts and paymasters are treated as **first-class citizens**, enabling uniform functionality.

**EIP-4337**:

- Introduces **smart contract accounts** but retains EOAs as separate entities.
- Paymasters are limited to smart contract accounts, excluding EOAs from benefitting.

### **3. Transaction Processing**

**Sophon (ZKsync Native AA)**:
- Features a **unified transaction flow** with a **single mempool** for both EOAs and smart contract accounts.
- The **Operator** bundles transactions (regardless of account type) and sends them to the **Bootloader**, which processes them seamlessly.

**EIP-4337**:

- Introduces a **separate transaction flow** for smart contract accounts.
- Relies on a separate **user operations mempool** and specialized nodes called **Bundlers** to group user operations.
- Requires 2 distinct flows for processing transactions:
  - Traditional flow for EOAs.
  - New flow for smart contract accounts via the **EntryPoint** contract.

### **4. Paymasters Support**

**Sophon (ZKsync Native AA)**:

- Supports **paymasters** for both EOAs and smart contract accounts due to its unified transaction flow.
- Enables seamless **gas abstraction**, allowing users to pay transaction fees in tokens rather than ETH.

**EIP-4337**:

- Paymasters are limited to the **new transaction flow** for smart contract accounts.
- EOAs are excluded from using paymasters, resulting in limited functionality.

## Why Sophon’s Native AA Matters

By utilizing **native account abstraction** instead of relying on EIP-4337, Sophon simplifies the user experience while enhancing the flexibility and functionality of accounts:

### **Advantages of Native AA on Sophon**

- **Unified User Experience**: No separate flows or complex infrastructure; all accounts behave consistently.
- **Gas Abstraction for All**: Both EOAs and smart contract accounts benefit from paymasters, making gas payments more user-friendly.
- **Streamlined Transactions**: A single mempool ensures faster and more efficient processing.
- **Protocol-Level Security**: Native integration eliminates reliance on external overlays, enhancing robustness and reducing vulnerabilities.

<Note>Sophon eliminates the need for complex infrastructure, making account abstraction seamless and efficient.</Note>

### **Enhancing Sophon Accounts with Paymasters**

Paymasters further elevate the functionality of Sophon accounts by:

- **Abstracting transaction fees:** Allowing applications to subsidize or manage gas fees on behalf of users.
- **Improving user experience:** Enabling gasless transactions and simplified interactions.

## Conclusion

Account abstraction is no longer just a theoretical leap. With Sophon’s native implementation, users and developers can harness the best of both **EOAs** and **Contract Accounts**, unlocking new possibilities for innovation and usability.
