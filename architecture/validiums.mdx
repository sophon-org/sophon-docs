## Key Features of Validiums

**Offchain Transaction Processing:** Validiums process most transactions offchain, reducing the load on the base layer. Only a limited set of transaction data is published to the Ethereum base layer, optimizing performance and lowering costs.

**Validity Proofs:** To ensure the integrity of offchain transactions, Validiums use validity proofs on Ethereum Layer 1. These proofs ensure that the transaction data is trustworthy and has not been tampered with.

**Transaction Verification:** A validity proof is attached to every batch of transactions before it is published on the Ethereum base layer. The Ethereum network only accepts and verifies these transactions if they are accompanied by a valid proof, confirming the correctness of the data.

### Sophon and Validiums

<Tip>
Sophon leverages **Validium technology** to provide an efficient, scalable solution. It will be implemented on the ZKsync Elastic Chain, bringing the benefits of Validiumâ€™s offchain processing and privacy features to the ZKsync ecosystem.
